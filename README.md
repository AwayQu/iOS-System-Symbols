# iOS-System-Symbols
Share iOS system symbol files copied from 'iOS DeviceSupport' folder. Useful for symbolicating iOS crash report.

The download address is in [collected-symbol-files.md](https://github.com/Zuikyo/iOS-System-Symbols/blob/master/collected-symbol-files.md).

When I get new symbol file, i will add it into the google drive sharing folder, and update the [collected-symbol-files.md](https://github.com/Zuikyo/iOS-System-Symbols/blob/master/collected-symbol-files.md).You can follow this repository to get the latest update.

## What's the use of system symbol files

It's for symbolicating those system frameworks in your iOS crash report.

When you get a crash report like this:

```

The callstack didn't catch your app's code, it only has code from system frameworks. So you need to symbolicate these system code.

Here is the symbolicated report, those`<redacted>` were changed into specific method names:

```
We can make out that the problem was caused by `UISearchDisplayController`'s`delegate`. It's`assign`. This crash happened when tap search bar while poping the viewController.

## The problem of symbolicating system frameworks

You may find out that you can't always symbolicate those system code. There're several problems:

* If you want to symbolicate system frameworks in your crash report, you need the corresponding system symbols, matching the OS Version and CPU architecture.
* Most system symbols can only be gained from physical iOS devices. Apple never  offer a website to download these symbols.
* You can download old versions of Xcode and pull out the SDK image you need. Usually the symbols are part of the latest Xcode release, but Apple doesn't always provide Xcode updates when an iOS version only contains bug-fixes but no API changes. And since Apple replace system framework with `tbd` files after Xcode7, this trick doesn't work any more. Read this for more details: [Xcode software image for user iOS in order to symbolicate iOS calls](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14941773/xcode-software-image-for-user-ios-in-order-to-symbolicate-ios-calls), [Missing iOS symbols at “~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport”](http://stackoverflow.com/a/28408052/6380485). (**Update**: Actually, since Xcode 6, there is no real device SDK. So you can only get SDKs before iOS 7 from Xcode.)

When you first connect a new iOS device to Xcode, Xcode will show a loading message: `Processing symbol files`(after Xcode 9, it's `Preparing debugger support for Device`). It's copying system symbol files from device to your Mac's path: `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport`.

That means you need a corresponding device if you want to symbolicate a crash report. There are 132 versions from `7.0 (11A465)` to `10.2.1 (14D27)`(most OS version contains three different type:`arm64`,`armv7s`,`armv7`. A`arm64`device contains both`arm64`and`armv7s`). That's obviously very difficult to collect them all.

That's the meaning of this repository, to share these system symbols.

## How to use

1. When you need to symbolicate a crash report, check the `Code Type` and `OS Version` section. Such as:`Code Type:       ARM-64`
`OS Version:      iOS 10.2 (14C82)`. That means you need `arm64`version symbols of `10.2 (14C82)`system.

2. Find the package in my sharing folder and extract it to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport`. (Check the file's name and path, it should be`~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport/10.2 (14C82)/Symbols`).

3. Use Xcode's`symbolicatecrash` tool to symbolicate your crash report. This tool will search system symbols in the`iOS DeviceSupport`path automatically. Read this to learn how to use`symbolicatecrash`: [Symbolicating an iOS Crash Report](https://www.apteligent.com/developer-resources/symbolicating-an-ios-crash-report/?partner_code=GDC_so_symbolicateios).

## Missing symbols

I still miss some symbols, if you have any of them, please share.

The missing list is in [collected-symbol-files.md](https://github.com/Zuikyo/iOS-System-Symbols/blob/master/collected-symbol-files.md)

## How to share your symbol files

### 1.Check which CPU version the symbol file contains

If you already have a system symbol file, and want to know which CPU version it contains, check files in the path like`10.2 (14C92)/Symbols/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld`. There should be files named`dyld_shared_cache_arm64`,`dyld_shared_cache_armv7s`,`dyld_shared_cache_armv7`.

If you miss one, that means you don't have that CPU version's symbols.

### 2.Merge the symbol files

If you have a device in the missing list, you may need to merge it's symbol files before sharing.

Xcode merges different CPU's symbol files to same folder. For example, if you already have a `arm64` version's symbol file in `iOS DeviceSupport` folder (such as `10.2 (14C82)`), when you connect a`armv7`device, Xcode will merge `armv7` version symbol files to `10.2 (14C82)` folder too.

So you need to download other CPU version's symbol files in my sharing folder(if it exists), extract it to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport`. Then connect your device, let Xcode merge those symbol files. 

Then we get a file containing `arm64`,`armv7s`and`armv7`. If you don't merge them, we'll have to distinguish the corresponding CPU version's symbol file when 
symbolicating.

### 3.Upload and share

Upload your files to your sharing drive, and commit the download address to [collected-symbol-files.md](https://github.com/Zuikyo/iOS-System-Symbols/blob/master/collected-symbol-files.md).
